# Data Analyst

# [Project 1: Comprehensive SQL Database System for Real-World Data Management]

* Developed a relational database system in Oracle SQL, focusing on normalizing tables to the third normal form and creating a 12-entity Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram (EERD) to address a real-world business scenario.
* Designed and implemented a detailed data dictionary that outlines entities, relationships, and attributes, aligning with identified business rules and user requirements for improved data integrity.
* Created SQL scripts to define tables, establish relationships, and populate them with initial data, ensuring data integrity and optimization across the database system.
* Formulated and executed 15 complex SQL queries, including 10 multi-table joins, to provide valuable business insights, all thoroughly tested and documented in Oracle Application Express with screenshots.


# [Project 2: CarMax Analytics]

* Analyzed a dataset of ~130,000 customer transactions to examine how appraised vehicles influence purchasing decisions, providing insights into customer behavior and trade-in trends.
* Utilized machine learning techniques, including decision trees and k-means clustering in Knime, to identify key factors impacting vehicle purchases and customer preferences.
* Conducted feature engineering and data preparation to enhance data quality and improve model performance, ensuring rigorous analysis and accuracy in findings.
* Created visualizations adhering to Tufteâ€™s data/ink principles to effectively communicate insights and trends, facilitating a clearer understanding of the data.
* Developed a comprehensive project report and presentation utilizing the Pyramid Principle to summarize key findings, recommendations, and strategies for enhancing CarMax's operations and customer experience.


# [Project 3: NYC Restaurant Inspection Analysis]

* Analyzed the NYC Restaurant Inspection Results dataset, which includes details on health inspections, violation descriptions, and restaurant grades, to enhance food safety transparency.
